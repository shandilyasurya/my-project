💡 Project Title

AI-Powered Chatbot (Nova) – Intelligent Conversational Assistant using MERN and Gemini API

🧠 Objective

To design and integrate an AI-powered chatbot into a full-stack MERN application with a provider-agnostic Node.js backend that can communicate with either Google Gemini API or Dialogflow.
The chatbot provides dynamic, context-aware responses, supports custom prompts, and maintains conversation history per user.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)
AI Model: Google Gemini 2.0 / 2.5 Flash via @google/genai SDK
Environment Management: dotenv
Communication: Axios
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients and glassmorphism
Animation: Framer Motion

🔍 Key Features

💬 Smart AI Responses

Uses Google Gemini API to dynamically generate conversational replies.

Falls back to predefined responses for general or casual inputs.

🧑‍💻 User & Bot Message Logging

Stores each user and bot message in MongoDB for session persistence.

Each entry includes timestamps, sender info, and conversation metadata.

⚙️ Provider-Agnostic Backend

The Express backend can easily switch between Gemini API or Dialogflow without code restructuring.

🔐 Secure Environment Setup

API keys stored safely using .env and accessed via process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY.

🌈 Interactive UI (Nova)

Responsive and minimal chat interface with animated message bubbles.

Built with TailwindCSS + Framer Motion for smooth transitions and typing feedback.

Glassmorphism theme, gradient buttons, and pulsing background effects.

⚡ Optimized Response Handling

Uses a temporary “Nova is thinking…” placeholder while the AI processes requests.

Smoothly replaces it with actual output once the response is received.

🧩 Modular Architecture

Clean code separation with controllers, models, routes, and frontend components.

💾 Session Management

Future-ready for user-specific sessions and message context preservation.

🚀 How It Works

The user enters a query in the Nova interface.

The message is sent to the backend API endpoint /bot/v1/message.

The server validates input, logs it, and checks for a predefined reply.

If no match is found, it uses Gemini API to generate a contextual response.

The backend saves both user and bot messages in MongoDB.

The frontend dynamically displays both messages with smooth animations.

🧩 Future Enhancements

🗣️ Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech features.

🌐 Integrate multi-language support (Gemini multilingual models).

🔄 Enable streaming responses (SSE/WebSocket) for real-time word-by-word replies.

🔐 Add authentication to manage per-user chat history.

📊 Implement chat analytics dashboard for admin insights.
