This project demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. 
It automates the process of testing, building, and deploying a Node.js application.
The workflow triggers on every push to the main branch, installs dependencies, runs tests, and builds the project. 
After a successful build, it automatically deploys the output to GitHub Pages using a secure Personal Access Token (PAT). 
This setup ensures continuous integration and deployment with minimal manual effort.This project demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
