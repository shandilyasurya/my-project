This project is a simple responsive banking user interface created using only HTML and CSS. 
It displays a balance amount along with two options labeled "Deposit" and "Withdraw." 
The design is clean, centered, and adapts to different screen sizes for better usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

HTML - 
In the HTML part, the structure begins with a main container called outer-container, which wraps all
the visible content. Inside it, there's a balance div that displays the current balance amount, for example, 
"Balance: â‚¹0.00". Below that, an inner-container div holds two more divs named deposit and withdraw. These two divs act like buttons and
represent the deposit and withdraw actions. The HTML 
does not contain any interactive functionality; it is only responsible for laying out the structure of the user
interface.

CSS - 
The CSS file handles all the visual styling and responsiveness of the layout. It begins by setting up general
rules such as centering the content in the middle of the screen, applying a background color, and using a 
clean font. The outer-container is styled to look like a card with padding, rounded corners, a white background, 
and a subtle box shadow. The balance is styled to appear in large, bold green text to stand out. The deposit and 
withdraw divs are styled to look like clickable buttons with proper padding, background colors (green for deposit and red
for withdraw), white text, and rounded edges. There are also hover effects added to both buttons to give visual feedback when hovered.

To make the layout responsive, a media query is used. By default, on larger screens, the deposit and withdraw sections 
are stacked vertically in a column layout. When the screen width goes below 480 pixels, the layout automatically changes
to a row layout so that the buttons appear side by side, which is more suitable for smaller screens like mobile devices.
