Learnings from the Experiment:
1. Understood how to create a responsive and accessible HTML form.
2. Learned how to use basic HTML5 form elements: <label>, <input>, <button>, etc.
3. Gained practical experience with form validations using required, minlength, maxlength, min, and max attributes.

Test Cases / Scenarios Covered:
1. Submitting form with empty fields – blocked due to 'required'.
2. Entering a name with less than 2 characters – blocked due to 'minlength'.
3. Entering a name longer than 50 characters – blocked due to 'maxlength'.

CSS Explanation:
1. font-family: Sets the font style of the whole page (Arial).
2. background: Light background applied to the body and white background to the form for clean contrast.
3. padding: Creates inner space inside elements like inputs and the form box for neat spacing.
4. border-radius: Rounds the corners of input fields and buttons for a soft, modern look.
