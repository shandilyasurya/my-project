Project: Admin Dashboard with CSS Grid Layout and Theme Switching -

This project is a simple admin dashboard webpage. It uses CSS Grid to organize the page layout into sections like header, navigation, main content, and footer. It also includes a dark mode toggle that changes the colors of the page using just CSS.

HTML Explanation -

The HTML file sets up the page structure.
It has a hidden checkbox to switch between light and dark mode.
The main parts are:
Header with the title and dark mode label.
Navigation menu with links to Home, User, and Settings.
Main section with a welcome message.
Footer with a copyright notice.

CSS Explanation - 

The CSS uses variables for colors so itâ€™s easy to switch themes.
The layout is done with CSS Grid dividing the page into columns and rows.
When the checkbox is checked, the CSS variables change to dark colors for the dark mode.
Each section (header, nav, main, footer) has styles for borders, colors, and spacing.
The dark mode toggle works without JavaScript by using the checkbox state in CSS.
